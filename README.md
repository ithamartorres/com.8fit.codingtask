# com.8fit.codingtask

SpringBoot project with the required task.

Requires gradle for compilation. It has some test cases where it is written the given example but it can also be tested
directly with any desired tool for Rest testing (curl, postman, etc).

URL with the requested API implementation is BASE_URL//workout-selectors (POST)

Main logic for code review process is located in the package com.eightfit.codingtask.service

There is one TODO: Explicitly there because besides the actual result, the software development process also take
into account the "release" process and in the TODO i wanted to show that part of what i think important is being able to
deliver "partial" but self/contained versions of software (at different levels)

Also includes the sql queries (tested in postgres) about some of data tasks.
